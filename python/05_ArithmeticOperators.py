# Basic Arithmetic Operators
number = 1 + 2 * 3 / 4.0
print("Squarred: %i" % number)

# Remainder
remainder = 11 % 3
print("Remainder: %i" % remainder)

# Using two multiplication symbols makes a power relationship.
squared = 7 ** 2
cubed = 2 ** 3
print(squared)
print(cubed)

# Using Operators with Strings
lotsofhellos = "hello " * 10
print(lotsofhellos)

# Using Operators with Lists
even_numbers = [2,4,6,8]
odd_numbers = [1,3,5,7]
all_numbers = odd_numbers + even_numbers
print(all_numbers)
# Just as in strings, Python supports forming new lists with a repeating sequence using the multiplication operator:
print([1,2,3] * 3)
